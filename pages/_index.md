I am Amuthan, Software engineer by profession, and doing some other thinks as a hobbyist. For documenting some of knowledge that I have, I created this personal blog. Here I may write computational stuffs, art perception, programming and some times little philosophy.

I do really care about what artistic style should I consume whether it is movie, book and any all other art forms. 
Feeling little shy to write more about me.
