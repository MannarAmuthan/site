The current generation (including me) have understood this patriarchal society and started to celebrate the independence and education of women (at least 50%). Also, this is the generation that is raised by people with patriarchal mindsets and thoughts. This is a great conflict and starts to produce a lot of pseudo thinkers, toxic men, and also creates a chaotic atmosphere. Men who were raised in a family where this patriarchy exists, have certain expectations on "How a woman should be", by looking at their mother (including me). Around these expectations, men grow up and build their mental strength around this illusion.

When they meet women who are independent, strong, all their expectations fall and start complaining about things. They canâ€™t bear mentally strong and independent women. We need to build the mindset that masculinity is independent, and it is not found in dominating the opposite sex. For men like the one that I mentioned above to get this mentality, they need to come across a lot of struggles and self-doubts. Exploration of the outer world is not only for women but also for men too. Truly strong men or women are created by the strong opposite sex.
