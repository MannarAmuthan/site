I always wondered how Vetrimaran crafts his films. This question should be asked for every creator’s works because each director has their own way of narrating the stories, creating characters, and building the world. Same goes for style, tone and treatment towards the plot. This rises a question that,  What a makes a director worth studying and celebrate or to simply ignore? It takes a lot of factors to decide the answer for the question, but just skip the part for now and get into the topic, let’s take a look at Vetrimaran’s world and characters. His world is ground rooted, and carefully designed to have realistic elements in them. One think that come to my mind when I look at his films is the fate of the characters, and how he narrates them. From Pollathavan to Asuran, the conscious of his stories hold some fundamental ideas such as determinism, fate and free will.

His scenes in the plot are carefully designed to have the details of causes and effects. One of the example where this concept almost perfected is Asuran. If we look into the story, The Wild boar entry into the land almost causes most of the events that occurred into the story after. Not only here, even in films such as Pollathavan, Adukalam and Vadachennai, all of them are carefully designed to have this **cause-and-effect chain**. But how these are connected with the themes that we mentioned above?. **To display the fate of the characters**, this small and granular level of details is much needed. This is brilliantly portrayed in Vadachennai film, where Jawa Palani character stabbed by Anbu. The poetic justice of the character is getting stabbed from someone who don’t have strong grief towards him and who is a locked in chaotic situation to kill him, just like how Java Palani himself stab the Rajan character. The entire events from Anbu and his lover caught while making love, upto the attempt of warning the Jawa Palani to not talk bad about his lover in the slum is told in very much detail. This much details towards the plot, make justification to the fate that is given to that character decently. **Without the details of events on how they are happened, the justice towards the character looks plain and forcefully fed,** especially on films which heavily depends on realism.

This is interesting when we think about how Vetrimaran has the ability to directly tell deterministic fate of the characters in the plot. Remember an interval scene from Vadachennai, where one of the character tells to their gang members not to leave the spot. He said , “Avangalallem angaye irukka sollu, ennamo ulla solluthu inniku Senthiloda voda kadaisi naal innikuthaanu (Ask them to stay their, inside me tells that today is Senthil’s last date)”,  Rajan wife’s warning to stay before he leaves the house, In Pollathavan Selvam’s words to his brother such as “Enna mudi da ithu , Virotha kaaran paatha , kaiyoda kondu poiruvaan” and “Annan illana, unna potruvaangeda”, there are many examples **where the character mentions about upcoming events of the plot.** This went another level when Rajan comments about current politics in Tamil Nadu before his murder. These things are carefully made considering both realistic elements in terms of words in dialogues and situations in the plot. Sometimes a magical realism filled moments such as, Women who tells Kuri (astrology) to Chandra character in Vadachennai, creates the same verisimilitude effect in the story.

Another technique that creates this deterministic world is Vetrimaran’s treatment towards time and space in the narration via thoughtful flashbacks. In Pollathavan, movie starts with Vasu’s intension to find the stolen bike, and when flashback narrates his love towards the motorcycle and introduce the characters and the motorcycle, we knew the past as well as present,  **it symbolises that what is going to happen is already determined**. In Vadachennai, Anbu’s journey to the story, and in Asuran, Vadakooran’s death all are already introduced to the audience , which is commentary over the fate of the all those characters which is also predetermined. This technique creates a **kind of lock where the characters are bound to act in world where the freewill is absented**. Of course this lock is not a real one, but just inside in an audience consciousness. 

There are lot of examples from Vetrimaran’s films where this illusion of narration between present and past used for creating this determinism in the story world. I don’t want mention all of those here. If you want, you can watch/rewatch the films. Stories are great, there is no doubt in that but it is very important to convert the frames and narration to manipulate the audience consciousness, ultimately they are the only thing that provides cinematic experience. These are some of the elements I personally think that makes director like **Vetrimaran as an auteur** and really standing out from the crowd.
