DNA is a fascinating thing to mankind, or at least to me. Because it contains traits or instructions, which is a “program”, that determines how tall a man will grow, his/her skin colour, and sometimes the list of diseases from which he is going to get sick, and other things. The question is, whether talent is also determined by it. Here, I am talking about Talent, not knowledge. Knowledge can be accumulated by reading books, but talent is more about the inherent ability of a person to do tasks and learn stuff. Maybe or may not be determined in DNA, but is that matters? Let us get into it without religiously looking at the DNA aspect of it, instead from other scientific perspectives.

Let us assume that talent is determined at birth. This is more like the survival of the fittest in Society. The mark that we secured in examinations, and the points that we scored in our sports competition is the only factor to decide our rank in the system. Just ask ourselves a question, do you think it is possible to get to the place where we are now and not below it if we are not born into a family where the parents sent us to tuition after school, and not for managing the herd, and where the dad spends his after job hours to clear our doubts, or at least care about your studies and not sleeps after tiresome labour work or not have the ability to clear your maths and science doubts?. This might look like an overstatement, but this is the reality around my village neighbourhood and even in most places. So, is the term “fittest” really represent your inherent ability here? 

Okay, let us turn the mirror on another side, Let us assume that talent is not determined at birth, and everyone has an equal ability to learn, and explore by birth. Then this lies towards a meritocracy. Even though the perspective is changed, the same set of questions could be asked for this statement also, and the same arguments can be matched in an exact manner. Now let us visits our first question, “Is Talent determined in birth?”, or Is it even matter? in the context of society, and equality, will it change anything?
