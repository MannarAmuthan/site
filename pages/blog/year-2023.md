This is a kind of summary post around my thoughts in 2023. It went too fast than usual, which is kind of less encouraging to me.  I usually don’t write this kind of dumps here, but why not. It is going to be unfiltered and raw. In Recent times, I am developing fear of forgetting life events. For instance, sometimes I think, is it happened in 2022 or 2021?, which is very big spectrum of fading memories. So I have decided to write things like this

**Blog:** 

To be honest, I wrote lot of articles often in notion, which should be published here. But I often struck in confident bias and made lot of mistakes in both Grammatical and contextual notion. ( you are free to judge me ). By the way, I wrote 4 articles , which is not great than I expected to write. This year, I planned to dump more frequently, so let’s see. 

**Fitness :**

No huge progress, maintaining decent abs, chest and less fat percentage. Tried to increase muscle mass while keeping body fat low, seems it requires considered amount of tracking and hustling. Which is not suitable for me, as I am more on autopilot mode. Let’s try this year. 

**Arts:**

This year is a favourite one for me in terms of this topic, because I reaffirmed my designing habits and the Instagram page which was created during my college. In those days, I was part of one college club as a designer, which is contributed on increasing  confidence level. Since I have some love for artworks, it become a neat combination and created art for some of my faviourite films. Planning to do this often, let’s see what can be done on this year.

**Projects:** 

When it comes to personal projects, this year has been bit of downfall. Creating an usable image editor like photoshop has been always my one of the goal. Started a project like that during April and able to close it on some logical level. Last year I had created the compiler backend for 8085 using LLVM, I am maintaining that one, for those few starrers of the project. Maintaining this project requires syncing LLVM upstream since mine is fork. 

Parsing, syntax building, grammar has been one of my faviourite genre in computer science, so I have created  Kural generator which takes an english statement as input, generate equavalent Thirukkural. It is long journey to create contextually correct Thirukkural but I am planning further on working in it, it requires huge effort on tagging each tokens of Kural, which is tiresome work, so let see whether it happens or not. 

**Open source:** 

Able to contribute to decent number of OSS projects on some of my favourite domains  Below is few of them, Thanks to Hacktoberfest 2023 facilitators of my organisation

These are some of the things that I wanted to write about this year, and I am not a big fan taking resolutions, so everything is not sure in 2024
