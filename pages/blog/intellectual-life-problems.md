I always think about what makes a man a thinker. And what makes him think? Is it always about a problem that is faced in his events of life, scarcity, lifestyle, death or existence? All the things that I listed above require a certain range of privileges to worry about. Of course, problems are very contextual and have different meanings from various perspectives. A Rich man would never need to worry about his hunger, he has other much things to worry about. This rise more questions in my mind. One of those is, Can a poor man become a thinker? In this context, I meant philosophical or ideological thinking rather than thoughts that revolve around essential actions and basic emotions.

A lot of folks (not excluding me) complains more about their lifestyle and the things of excess. And there are people who don’t have the privilege of spending time sitting and worrying about things other than food and shelter. I am not talking motivational bullshits, such as “your problems are better than theirs”, or something like that. But, I just want to confess that, If these philosophical arguments/thoughts are considered superior, then they should be considered privileged. (not excluding me :))

There are people who troll the free benefits/food/stuff that is provided by the government to people, which often helps to reduce difficulty in essential life and which helps to accumulate some time for other things in their life. I considered those to be one of the great things that are happening in the modern era. Because when people are fed, they start to think and try to improve their lifestyle or at least they start to worry about those things.
