Breaking Bad has been one of my favourites since my college days, I have never watched anything like that over this span of 5 to 6 years. The theme or idea that attracted me so much in the series is, the change of the main character. Of course, the entire show is about that change, but what interested me is the question raised in myself. That is “Is Walter white responsible for all of his actions?”. Here I don’t only quote the disease that he got, which is the cause of all the things, but the entire events and how he reacts and makes decisions. In the end, Did he deserve all the hate and blames?, and in different words, “Did he ever have free will?”. This applies to everyone, not only to Walter White from breaking bad. Do we responsible for all the actions we have made? There might be two possibilities here.

People who believe in astrology and horoscopes have faith in Fate, destiny and karma. This means all of our actions are determined already, and we are in autopilot mode, driven by some factors. Here I am only talking fate part of Astrology, not about the planets in the universe and their influence on the tiny humans on earth, which is complete nonsense. (I don’t want to argue here with pseudo-science). And another possibility is that our actions are completely controlled by us, within our hands to our ability, sensibility and conciseness. To me, Either one is true or may not.

If the first argument is true, then we don’t give a shit about anything, because we are not owning any of our actions and decisions, and can live a guilt-free life. If it is the second one, we can argue that the situations and external factors are responsible for some of the decisions we have made like Walter White. Still some decisions are owned by us, which will later be the foundation of our guilt and shame, and it is tough to live with. This might be the reason why people like to believe the first one.
