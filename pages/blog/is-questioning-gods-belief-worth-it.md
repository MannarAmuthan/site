There is no straightforward approach on this topic. Because I saw a lot of people who believe in God and not in Religions and vice versa. Questioning scientific explanations on the existence of god to either category of people,  won’t make any sense and trust me you won’t get any answers for your skeptical mind. Often it ends up with a poor attempt of connecting religious rituals to science and disconnected bad explanations from philosophy. You might argue it is very subjective that the separation between real and pseudo arguments. I would say no, it is not. Bad arguments must convince themselves of logical and scientific concepts, where it is implicit for Good or real arguments.

I personally see the belief of god and religions as a part of human evolution. Agriculture , Dressing culture and a lot of habits and lifestyles are hugely deviated from scientific logic. We can’t explain them why they exist. Same goes for the arguments about God. You will get a variety of answers and none of them makes sense. Religion, God all are formed as part of evolution,  natural selection and they are accidents. Other ideas can't beat these things, so they didn’t survive in front of these concepts.
